## Objective

This **SOC Deployment** project involved setting up a Security Operations Center (SOC) using Microsoft Sentinel to monitor and analyze security events in real-time. To simulate a real-world attack environment, the RDP port was deliberately left open to attract potential attackers, enabling the detection of malicious activity. A custom threat intelligence feed was integrated, providing real-time updates on new threats, while the Mitre ATT&CK framework focused on identifying Initial Access tactics to enhance early-stage threat detection.

### Skills Learned
- SIEM deployment, configuration, and management.
- Threat intelligence integration to enhance detection capabilities.
- Log analysis and event correlation for effective monitoring.
- Security event monitoring and incident detection.
- Application of MITRE ATT&CK framework (Initial Access tactics).

### Tools Used
- **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)**: Hosted the environment for monitoring and SIEM deployment.
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Deployed SIEM for log analysis and security monitoring.
- **Log Analytics Workspace**: Centralized log management for security event analysis.
- **Windows Security Events (via Azure Monitor Agent)**: Collected and analyzed security event logs.

## Steps

### Resource Group Overview

The Resource Group Overview page provides a comprehensive view of all associated resources, including the virtual machine, network security group, virtual network, and associated disks, illustrating the infrastructure setup for the SOC deployment.

### Sentinel Rule Query - General Success Activity

This screenshot displays the query that filters for general successful activities where Activity contains "success". Severity: Informational. This rule captures all successful login events, providing a baseline for monitoring and establishing normal activity patterns.

### Sentinel Rule Query - Success Activity Excluding System Accounts

The second screenshot shows the query that filters for successful activities while excluding system accounts: SecurityEvent where Activity contains "success" and Account !contains "system". Severity: Medium. This rule refines the monitoring to focus on user accounts only, reducing noise from system accounts and highlighting potentially significant login events.

### Sentinel Rule Query - User Accounts Excluding Specific VM

The third screenshot illustrates the query that filters for user account activities excluding a specific VM: SecurityEvent where AccountType contains "user" and Account !contains "SOCVM". Severity: High. This rule is set to high severity as it targets user activities while explicitly excluding a known device used for testing, increasing the likelihood of detecting unusual or unauthorized user behavior.

### Sentinel Overview

The Sentinel Overview page, captured an hour after deployment, showcases the collected events, generated alerts, and logs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SOC setup in monitoring and detecting security activities.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in SOC deployment, SIEM configuration, and enhanced detection using threat intelligence feeds, making it a valuable exercise for cybersecurity skill development.
